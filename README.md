# Git Practice

A Repository for practicing Git: branches, merges, rebases, commits, and much more.

## Structure

- todo.txt -> simple tasks to modify and commit
- src/ -> scripts for feature branches and merges
- docs/ -> notes and documentation edits
- tests/ -> files to simulate test-driven commits


## Goals

- Practice creating branches and merging
- Resolve conflicts safely
- Experiment with rebase, amend, and squash
- Use stash, reset, and reflog.
